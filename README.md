# Connor's Neapolitan Style Pizza Process
</div>

In 2016 I got by first backyard pizza oven, the Uuni (now Ooni) 2S. Since then, I have enjoyed making pizzas with friends and family. Now that these ovens are becoming more common, I have had multiple people ask me about recipes and the techniques I use, so I have decided to compile them into this online resource so they are easier to share. I hope you enjoy!

I'm assuming that you have already got your hands on a pizza oven before reading this, but before we get to the recipes, I will go over some of the supplies that I use. You may not need all of these items, but if you are going to be making pizzas frequently and want to get consistent results, then these are the ones that I recommend:

## Equipment:

1. A digital scale that can weigh items to 0.1 or 0.01 grams.
    
         You will need the high precision to weigh the light ingredients like the yeast. As you get more experience you will also want to play with the ratios of water to flour so you will want to measure your ingredients by weight rather than by cups or tablespoons. 

2. Digital infrared thermometer that can measure up to 500 degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit).

        This will come in handy measuring the temperature of your pizza stone in your oven. 

3. Pizza peel (one should have come with the oven).

4. Stand mixer with dough attachment.

        You can make the dough by hand kneading it, but I find it much easier to use a mixer with a dough attachment.

5. A fine mesh strainer if you want to make your own sauce.

6. A container and/or pan for the dough to rise in. 

        During the bulk stage of the dough rise, you can leave the dough in a bowl covered with saran wrap, but once you divide it up into individual dough balls for the pizzas, you will need either a baking sheet with saran wrap covering everything, or you could use a proofing tray with a lid. I haven't bought a proofing tray yet, but it's on the list of items I would like to get.

## Dough Ingredients:

1. Type 00 (double zero) flour  

        This type of flour allows the dough to form strong gluten bonds that allow it to be able to be stretched thin for the pizza base. I usually use a 1 kg bag to make 8 pizzas. 

2. Yeast (I use active dry yeast)

        Different recipes will use either fresh yeast, active dry yeast, or instant yeast. I have only ever used active dry yeast since that is the first one I bought. Until I try the others, the recipes I share will stick to the active dry yeast. 

3. Salt

4. Water (warm temperature to activate the yeast)

        The water will need to be warm to activate the yeast, but not too hot. One method I have seen in the Ooni recipes is to measure all the water as cold tap water, then boil one third of it. When you combine it all back together, the proper temperature will be reached. I have tried this method, and I have also just used water that wasn't too hot for my hand and both have worked for me. 

5. Semolina flour for dusting the pizza peel (optional)

        Before you put your pizza on your peel, you will need to put a dusting of some sort of flour on the peel to prevent the pizza from sticking to it. I put this item as optional because you can just use regular flour for this. The semolina flour doesn't burn as easily as regular flour, so you won't get as much of the burnt flour taste on your pizza if you use this. 

6. Olive oil.

        The olive oil is for greasing the containers/pans that the dough sits in to rise. I also brush it on the outside surface of the dough balls while they rise to prevent them from drying out. 

## Toppings:

#### Cheese:

    I get my cheese from an italian grocery store. It is the fresh fior di latte mozzarella cheese you get as large balls that sit in brine. Another alternative I have used is the same type of cheese that comes pre-packaged from Costco. I like both of them. I usually get one large cheese ball for 3-4 pizzas. 

#### Sauce: 

    I have only tried two different sauce recipes, but I like a certain one so much that I just stick to it. I will share the link to the sauce recipe later on. Using premade sauce works as well, but I would try to find one that is an uncooked sauce, or at least a sauce from an italian market. Regular pizza sauce off the shelf at a normal grocery store probably wouldn't be that good. 

#### Other Toppings:

    - Fresh basil leaves
    - Your favorite meats (I like a spicy genoa salami or prosciutto from an italian deli.)
